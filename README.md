## Installation

```
$ npm install -g orchy
```

## Configure web hooks and start the server

Create a `configuration.json` file with the following contents:

```json
[
    {
        "id": "main",
        "dir": ".",
        "secret": "secret-token",
        "commands": [
            "pwd",
            "git branch",
            "git status"
        ]
    }
]
```

Now, run the orchy server under [http://localhost:8181](http://localhost:8181)

```shell
$ orchy
```

To run it on a different port:

```
$ PORT=8282 orchy
```

To execute the `main` configuration, open [http://localhost:8181/run?definition=main&secret=secret-token](http://localhost:8181/run?definition=main&secret=secret-token) in your browser or run the following in terminal

```
$ curl "http://localhost:8181/run?definition=main&secret=secret-token"
```

while the browser will show only a `success` message, the server will give you more feedback

## Feedback from the server

When `configuration.json` file is missing:

```shell
$ orchy

[Err] Failure reading configuration.json
```

When `configuration.json` has a wrong format:

```shell
$ orchy

[Err] Configuration file is not structured properly
Error at array index 0: Error at property "commands": Type mismatch: expected array, found Undefined
```

When selected definition is not present in the configuration:

```shell
$ orchy

[Log] Orchy server is running at http://localhost:8181
[Log] Incoming request /run?definition=unknown&secret=unknown
[Err] Definition with provided id and secret not found
```

When definition exists but one of the commands fails:

```shell
$ orchy

[Log] Orchy server is running at http://localhost:8181
[Log] Incoming request /run?definition=main&secret=secret-token
[Log] Running definition "main"
[Log] Executing pwd
/Users/maciejsmolinski/git/orchy
[Log] Executing git branch
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
Process exited with status code 128

[Err] Execution FAILED
```

Finally, when everything succeeds:

```shell
$ orchy

[Log] Orchy server is running at http://localhost:8181
[Log] Incoming request /run?definition=main&secret=secret-token
[Log] Running definition "main"
[Log] Executing pwd

[Log] Executing git branch
