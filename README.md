# Orchy

ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èA simple, opinionated web hooks manager. Built with PureScript.

## Running the server

```shell
$ npm install -g orchy
$ orchy
```

The web hooks server will run under [http://localhost:8181](http://localhost:8181)

## Configuring hooks

Create a `configuration.json` file with the following contents:

```json
[
    {
        "id": "main",
        "dir": ".",
        "secret": "secret",
        "commands": [
            "pwd",
            "git branch",
            "git status"
        ]
    }
]
```

To execute the `main` configuration, open [http://localhost:8181/run?definition=main](http://localhost:8181/run?definition=main) in your browser or run the following in terminal

```
$ curl http://localhost:8181/run?definition=main
```

while the browser will show only the `success` message, the server will give you more feedback

## Feedback

When `configuration.json` file is missing:

```shell
$ orchy

[Err] Failure reading configuration.json
```

When `configuration.json` has a wrong format:

```shell
$ orchy

[Err] Configuration file is not structured properly
Error at array index 0: Error at property "commands": Type mismatch: expected array, found Undefined
```

When selected definition is not present in the configuration:

```shell
$ orchy

[Log] Orchy server is running on http://localhost:8181

[Log] [HTTP/GET] /run?definition=unknown

[Err] Definition with id "unknown" not found
```

When definition exists but one of the commands fails:

```shell
$ orchy

[Log] Orchy server is running on http://localhost:8181

[Log] [HTTP/GET] /run?definition=main

[Log] Running definition "main"

```

Finally, when everything succeeds:

```shell
$ orchy

[Log] Orchy server is running on http://localhost:8181

[Log] [HTTP/GET] /run?definition=main

[Log] Running definition "main"

[Log] Executing pwd
